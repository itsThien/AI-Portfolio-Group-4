# Project 1 – Administrative AI Agent (DeepLearning-ITAI2376)

This project implements an **administrative assistant agent** that automates a multi-step workflow:

> Organize a department kickoff meeting and handle scheduling, documentation, reminders, and follow-ups.

The agent is designed as a **portfolio-quality system** that demonstrates:

- A coherent **agent architecture** (input, memory, reasoning, output)
- The **Planning-then-Execution** agent pattern
- **Tool integration** (calculator + document summarizer)
- Simple **reinforcement learning–style feedback** and policy improvement
- **Safety and security measures** (input validation, boundaries, fallbacks, transparency)
