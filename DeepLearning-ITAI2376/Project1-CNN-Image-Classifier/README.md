# Project 1 — CNN Image Classifier (CIFAR-10)

## 📌 Overview
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 categories.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Build an image classifier capable of recognizing objects such as airplanes, cats, cars, and ships.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Custom CNN built using PyTorch  
- Trained using Adam optimizer  
- Data augmentation for robustness  
- Evaluated on accuracy and loss  

## 🧪 Results
Placeholder results:
- Accuracy: **~75%**
- Loss reduced steadily over training

## 🧬 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding CNN architecture  
- Training neural networks in PyTorch  
- Evaluating classification models
