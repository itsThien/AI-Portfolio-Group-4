# Project 2 — Object Detection using Transfer Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies transfer learning to perform object detection using a pre-trained model such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Improve detection accuracy on a custom or small dataset using pre-trained models.

## 🧠 Approach
- Transfer learning with a pretrained model  
- Fine-tuning final layers  
- Bounding box and object class predictions  

## 🧪 Results
Placeholder results (visual examples stored in `/results`).

## 🧬 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding transfer learning  
- Using pre-trained detection models  
- Visualizing predictions
