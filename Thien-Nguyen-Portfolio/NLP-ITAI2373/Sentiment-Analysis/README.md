# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model that classifies text as either positive or negative.

## Problem Statement
Understanding sentiment in text is important for product reviews, social media monitoring, and automated feedback systems.

## Approach & Methodology
- Tokenization and sequence padding  
- Embedding layer for word representation  
- LSTM network for sequence learning  
- Softmax classifier for prediction  

## Results & Evaluation
Placeholder metrics:
- Accuracy: **~86%**
- Loss decreased significantly  

## Learning Outcomes
I learned:
- How LSTMs process sequential text  
- How to prepare text datasets  
- How to train NLP models  

## Requirements
torch
numpy
pandas
spacy
