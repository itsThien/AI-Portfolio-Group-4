# Edge AI Sensor Monitoring (ESP32)

## Overview
This project simulates real-time sensor monitoring on an ESP32 microcontroller, demonstrating how lightweight AI models can be integrated into IoT systems.

## Problem Statement
Edge devices have low processing power. We must use tiny, efficient ML models to analyze sensor data in real time.

## Approach
- Simulated sensor data (temperature values)  
- Python script emulates microcontroller behavior  
- Placeholder to represent TinyML workflow  

## Results
- Sensor values print to terminal every second  
- Script demonstrates edge workflow logic  

## Learning Outcomes
I learned:
- How edge devices read sensors  
- The structure of TinyML pipelines  
- How to format data for real-time inference  

## How to Run
```bash
python edge_script.py
